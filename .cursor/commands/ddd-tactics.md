Run the action on ddd at tactics fidelity through the tools cli

Provide guidance for creating bounded contexts, building blocks, and tactics.
When DDD scaffolding is ready, call guidance on the CE companion and pass that companion to this action as a separate tools run for matching OO artifacts.
Scan the production source for every public method and property; flag any with no corresponding test as a coverage gap. Fix every BDD violation and coverage gap — confirm each failing test is RED for the right reason.
If the same test is still RED after 2 consecutive fix attempts — stop guessing. Call diagnostic().diagnose() before a third fix (wrong exception, wrong line, shifting failure mode, or a re-read of the code that does not explain the failure).
When this DDD work is done, call guidance on the Clean Engineering companion and pass that companion to this action as a separate tools run. The action already knows what to do for every tool. Do not inline.

Provide guidance from contexts, examples, and templates.

# Contexts

## tactics

**Default format:** Python

**Goal:** Implement the domain and building-block seams (repos, events, factories, …) against a chosen architecture.

- Preserve names from the CE / building-blocks model.
- Implement repository persistence, event publication/handling, factories, services as decided upstream.
- **Architecture** — from project context (`.context/`, ADRs, stack). If none, **ask**. If none available, default: Node-shaped app + **JSON file persistence** (package TBD).
- Domain model free of UI/transport; persistence and messaging behind ports.
- **`load-with-identity-in-hand`** — When wrapping live, `load` takes the identity already in hand. Do not assume a browser session. Load once and reuse the variable. A cart has no identity outside its prospect — reach it through the owner, not `cartRepository().current()`.
- Call clean_engineering at **code**.

# Bounded Context Map — Shop

## Catalog | custom

Product identity and pricing — slower-changing than checkout.

### Product

- Product
→ Sales · ShoppingCart · CartItem

## Sales | custom

Shopping carts, checkout, discounts.

### ShoppingCart

- CartItem
- Discount
- unit_price snapshot → Catalog · Product
→ Catalog · Product

  Bounded Context Map — tree format



  BC → Aggregate → concept. Links on any level:

  → BC · Aggregate · Entity   (another context; omit leading segments when same BC/aggregate)

  → System · Entity           (external vendor / system of record)



  building_blocks fidelity adds CE compact classes under each aggregate (not shown here).

# Bounded Context Map — {{project_name}}



## Map format



Three levels: **BC** → **Aggregate** → **concept**.



`→ BC · Aggregate · Entity` — cross-context (drop segments when same BC or aggregate).



`→ System · Entity` — external system (e.g. `→ Mavenir DEP · engagedParty`).

Separate tools run — toolset: `context_tools.clean_engineering.clean_engineering:CleanEngineering` action: `guidance` context.fidelity: `code`

Every tool call uses this shape - set `tool` and `arguments`, pipe to CLI:

```yaml
toolset: context_tools.ddd.ddd:Ddd
context:
  fidelity: tactics
tool: <tool name>
arguments:
  <if needed>
```

Run: python -m tools run -

Before following the suggested flow, display the tools made available to this chat in your user-visible reply — each tool name and what it is for. Do not only follow them silently or rediscover them by remanifesting.

Tools made available:
- guidance

Suggested flow (repeat and reorder as the story needs):

1. tool: guidance

Read `resources` from each response before choosing the next tool.

With a straight prompt passed, take the action from the prompt. If you took an action from the context versus being given a straight prompt, confirm the use of the context. AskQuestion constrained to these actions: car-inspect | createRule | document | generate | grill | iterate | partition | render | repair | satisfy | scan | sketch | travel-to | validate.
Then run:
Pipe the fence to stdin from the repo root. Do not write a request file. Do not remanifest — this skill is the catalog. Follow response.instructions only.
```yaml
toolset: context_tools.ddd.ddd:Ddd
context:
  fidelity: tactics
action: generate
```
