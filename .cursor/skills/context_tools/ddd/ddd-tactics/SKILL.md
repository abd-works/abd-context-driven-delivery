# Contexts

## tactics

**Default format:** Python

**Goal:** Implement the domain and building-block seams (repos, events, factories, …) against a chosen architecture.

- Preserve names from the CE / building-blocks model.
- Implement repository persistence, event publication/handling, factories, services as decided upstream.
- **Architecture** — from project context (`.context/`, ADRs, stack). If none, **ask**. If none available, default: Node-shaped app + **JSON file persistence** (package TBD).
- Domain model free of UI/transport; persistence and messaging behind ports.
- **`load-with-identity-in-hand`** — When wrapping live, `load` takes the identity already in hand. Do not assume a browser session. Load once and reuse the variable. A cart has no identity outside its prospect — reach it through the owner, not `cartRepository().current()`.
- Call clean_engineering at **code**.

  Bounded Context Map — tree format



  BC → Aggregate → concept. Links on any level:

  → BC · Aggregate · Entity   (another context; omit leading segments when same BC/aggregate)

  → System · Entity           (external vendor / system of record)



  building_blocks fidelity adds CE compact classes under each aggregate (not shown here).

# Bounded Context Map — {{project_name}}



## Map format



Three levels: **BC** → **Aggregate** → **concept**.



`→ BC · Aggregate · Entity` — cross-context (drop segments when same BC or aggregate).



`→ System · Entity` — external system (e.g. `→ Mavenir DEP · engagedParty`).
