# Contexts

Map stakeholder and system interactions as behaviours that deliver a solution.

Interactions fit into a hierarchy: a `StoryMap` of `Epic` → nestable `SubEpic` → `Story`. Each story is `Scenario`s with discrete steps; backgrounds and scenarios carry examples.

| Fidelity | Default Format | Produce |
|---|---|---|
| **story_map** | markdown | Story map |
| **scenarios** | python | Main-flow scenarios per story — `{story}.{tier}.py` GWT files. Pass `format markdown` only when the strategy asks for a markdown view. |
| **acceptance_tests** | python | Same `{story}.{tier}.py` tree as scenarios. CE runs alongside for wrap classes. |

**Templates** live under `templates/` per format. **Scanners** read the canonical model only — never language syntax.

## Shared rules

- **`vocabulary-traces-to-domain-source`** — Trace terms to domain language / model when present.
- **`artifacts-mirror-story-hierarchy`** — Mirror Epic → SubEpic → Story on disk as folders for epic and sub-epic, and as `{story}.{tier}.py` files (no per-story directory).
- **`read-all-source-context-in-full`** — Before locking hierarchy **and before any grill/iterate question about a seam**, prove-read **every relevant referenced context** for that decision: owning `*-segment.md`, `module-context.md`, session sketches / grill-answers / handoff, peer story-context, build-order, and any path the plan or prior answers cite. Index / mid-epic stub columns are structure hints only — **not** story inventory. Grep or primer-only skims do not count; cite concrete terms from the files read in the question turn. Also re-read these rules. Do not thin from titles or memory!
- **`do-not-invent-requirements`** — Only model behaviours present in source context or an explicit ask. Never invent:
  - status concepts, maintenance signals, warning badges, or config columns (e.g. `Status (ok/stale)`) the source does not require — unconfigured / not-yet-current = **no row** + the existing fallback, never a new invented state to render;
  - a second, competing command / invoke surface beside one the user already specified (e.g. a raw YAML `toolset`/`fidelity`/`action` "Invoke" block given equal billing next to an already-locked `/{skill} <action> {fidelity}` line). Keep the specified surface primary; any secondary format is a subsidiary link at most — never inlined, never a co-equal page element.

## story_map

**Default format:** markdown

**Goal:** Shape the hierarchy — `Epic` → nestable `SubEpic` → `Story` — decomposed on real mechanical variation, not requirement-row bookkeeping.

**Produce:** Story map.

### Rules

- **`verb-noun-format`** — Name Epic / SubEpic / Story verb–noun; actor is metadata; base verb form.
- **`four-to-nine-children`** — 4–9 direct children (warn at 3/10; error ≤2 or ≥11).
- **`branch-on-mechanical-uniqueness`** — Explore context relentlessly for distinct mechanics. Branch on mechanical uniqueness, dstinct mechanics in requirements require *distinct stories* for each mechanic. Different requirement entries with same mechanic is *one story only with different examples or scenarios*. Collapsing real mechanical variation, as well as mindlessly turning requirements into long lists of stories are **defect**
- **`right-size-story-nodes`** — One demonstrable interaction per story.
- **`behaviours-not-one-time-tasks`** — A Story is a repeatable stakeholder/system interaction you can specify Given/When/Then against more than once. One-time maintainer chores (rename X to Y, copy/migrate an asset once, one-off repo surgery) are not Stories — keep them in the plan/todos. Once done, the result is ordinary inventory the remaining stories already cover.
- **`do-not-invent-requirements`** — same rule as Shared: no invented Status/stale/warning-badge concepts; no competing command/invoke surface beside one already specified; unconfigured = no row + existing fallback.

---

## scenarios

**Default format:** python

**Goal:** Main-flow scenarios per story (single or multiple) with optional variations.

**Produce:** Same `{story}.{tier}.py` tree as acceptance_tests. Pass `format markdown` only when the strategy command names it.

### Rules

- **`behavioral-observable-outcomes`** — Name and Then in domain-observable terms; never internals.
- **`explore-full-interaction-surface`** — Scenarios are not complete when only the main-flow GWT from the sketch is written. Before locking scenarios (and again before acceptance_tests), walk the real UI and model **every distinct user-visible behavior**: inline rule checklists and how they change while typing, field-level validation errors clearing as input conforms, cross-field rules (confirm password, paste mismatch), submit-button gating, and server-side error surfaces. A story that only codifies the happy path when the screen has rich client-side validation is a **defect** — branch into additional scenarios (or scenario outlines with examples) per mechanical variation, not one paragraph that mentions "validation" in passing.
- **`gwt-steps-trace-to-domain-operations`** — Every Given / When / Then maps to a named domain operation or property. If a step cannot be traced, that is a modelling gap — add the operation or property; do not gloss over it. A hop to the next step is a named operation on the arriving aggregate (`prospect.verifyIdentity()`), not a route, `waitForCompletion()`, or driving the next concern through the previous aggregate.
- **`reconcile-live-immediately`** — The running app wins. When a walk-through disagrees with the sketch, fix the sketch in that increment before locking the test.
- **`explain-deep-link-arrival`** — A scenario that navigates to a parameterized route (`/sign-up/:planId`) must say how a user actually arrives: in-app navigation, marketing/external deep-link, or a wizard step with no URL change. Do not write `When they navigate to X` as if it were a button.
- **`given-only-what-the-system-checks`** — Given states conditions the **running system actually uses** for the behaviour under test. Do not Given a field the code never reads for that decision (`metadata.verified` when routing actually keys off `customer.billing.id`).
- **`when-holds-the-operation`** — When holds the domain operation being exercised. An empty When with a comment, or the operation called inside Then, is a defect. Then only asserts on what When already produced — no I/O in Then.
- **`then-and-chaining`** — The first outcome uses `then()`; every later outcome on the same interaction chains `.and()`. Repeated `then()` calls break the Gherkin narrative. Markdown `And` stays `And`.
- **`extract-assertion-helper`** — The same assertion shape more than twice becomes a named helper that takes a data bag. Call sites pass only the concrete values.
- **`infrastructure-in-lifecycle-hooks`** — Browser boot, app wiring, and `initialize` live in `beforeAll` / `afterAll`. `given(` is domain state only.
- **`load-with-identity-in-hand`** — `load` takes the identity already in hand. Do not assume a browser session. Load once at the highest Given that needs the aggregate and reuse the variable. A cart has no identity outside its prospect — reach it through the owner, not `cartRepository().current()`.
- **`seed-prior-story-as-given`** — A later story's Given is seeded from prior-story fixtures (`givens.py` / `examples/`), not a replay of that story's When.
- **`reuse-owning-aggregate-stubs`** — For a non-core aggregate, take stubs from **that aggregate's folder / source repository** (`domain/{bounded-context}/{aggregate}/stubs/{system}/`). Do not invent a test-local stub. Do not stub the seam you are proving.

---

## acceptance_tests

**Default format:** python

**Goal:** Turn locked scenarios into runnable acceptance coverage; CE runs alongside to produce matching wrap classes under `domain/`.

**Tooling & Idioms:** Refer to [`context_tools/language-tools.md`](/context_tools/language-tools.md) for language-specific tool recommendations and idiomatic patterns for tests.

**Produce:** `tests/{epic}/{sub-epic}/{story}.{tier}.py` — one GWT file per story per seam. `{tier}` is `front-end`, `back-end`, or any other system name you are proving. No `{story}/` folder and no `*_story` / `*_test_helper` split.

### Rules

- **`behavioral-observable-outcomes`** — same rule as **scenarios**: assertions stay in domain-observable terms, never internals.
- **`explore-full-interaction-surface`** — same rule as **scenarios**: acceptance_tests must cover the explored interaction surface, not just translate the first main-flow scenario into Playwright. Trace react-hook-form rules, shared validation components, and stubbed failure modes during the sandbox walk-through; add a `scenario()` per distinct behavior.
- **`gwt-steps-trace-to-domain-operations`** — same rule as **scenarios**: each step in the test traces to a named domain operation or property. A hop to the next step is a named operation on the arriving aggregate, not a route or `waitForCompletion()`.
- **`reconcile-live-immediately`** — same rule as **scenarios**: live disagreement updates the sketch before the test is locked.
- **`explain-deep-link-arrival`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`given-only-what-the-system-checks`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`when-holds-the-operation`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`then-and-chaining`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`extract-assertion-helper`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`infrastructure-in-lifecycle-hooks`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`load-with-identity-in-hand`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`seed-prior-story-as-given`** — same rule as **scenarios**.
- **`reuse-owning-aggregate-stubs`** — same rule as **scenarios**.

# Scaffold

A scaffold produces a thin epic index — **names only**: verb–noun epics + story names (`StoryMap` → `Epic` → `SubEpic` → `Story`). No Scenario at scaffold.

Key rules: `branch-on-mechanical-uniqueness` — split on distinct mechanics, not catalog/requirements rows; `read-all-source-context-in-full` — read segments in full before grouping.
