# # Params — fill before writing code
# epic:       {epic-verb-noun}           # kebab folder under tests/
# sub_epic:   {sub-epic-verb-noun}       # kebab folder under epic/ (omit level if story hangs off epic)
# story:      {story-verb-noun}          # Verb Noun title from the story map
# story_file: {story_snake_slug}         # snake file slug, e.g. sign_up_create_account
# tier:       e2e | front-end | back-end | {system}

# # Artifact layout (artifacts-mirror-story-hierarchy)
# tests/
#   {epic-verb-noun}/
#     {sub-epic-verb-noun}/              # omit when the story file lives under epic/
#       {story_snake_slug}.{tier}.py     # one GWT file per story per tier
#
# # Machinery — copy once per tests/ tree if missing (do not inline in skills):
#   context_tools/stories/templates/py/story_test.py → tests/story_test.py
# story_test: tests/story_test.py
#
# # Naming rules
# - Epic / SubEpic folders → kebab-case verb-noun (Sign Up → sign-up)
# - Story test file        → {story_snake_slug}.{tier}.py at epic or sub-epic — NO {story}/ folder
# - Tier                   → file extension segment (.e2e.py, .front-end.py, .back-end.py)
# - Forbidden              → {story}/ folders, *_story.*, *_test_helper.* splits
# ```
#
# Pattern: GWT structure only — replace pass with real code under each with.
