<!--
  clean_engineering markdown template — unified across all fidelities.

  I{ClassName} is not the default. When generated, it lives in the same file /
  same module H1 as {ClassName} — public members only on I{ClassName}; private
  members stay on {ClassName}. Omit ## I{ClassName} unless the user asked or
  multiple implementations sit behind one seam.

  Fidelity tags on section headings (as HTML comments — informational only):
    L  = language (prose identity; refined at every stage — not a fidelity)
    Mu = modules        (thin terms, one-way deps, build order; no I{Class} yet)
    Md = model          (I{ClassName} — typed compact block — ONLY when an interface is
                         requested; otherwise model is the empty `## {ClassName}` block)
    C  = code           (fill {ClassName}; public filled, privates filled; drop interactions)

  Class member format (model):
    ------  (six dashes)   constructor / properties separator
    ----    (four dashes)  properties / operations separator
    -       (dash prefix)  private operation
    +       (plus prefix)  public — code fidelity only

  Invariants, interactions, comments (model):
    Write each invariant as `//` on the class (or under the property / operation
    it constrains): a must / never / always / before / after that stays true
    when the object acts.
    Write each interaction as `-> {collaborator}.{operation}` nested under the
    calling operation. `-> ClassName` alone is not an interaction.
    State an invariant or a sequence with `//`. Leave every other line
    uncommented.

  Put a class family in one file: the primary type, its subtypes, and
  tightly connected peers that only make sense together (element +
  collection, small aggregate + its part). Name the file after the family
  concept (`abilities.py` for Ability + Abilities). Split into another
  file only when a type is independently reused across families or the
  file becomes a grab-bag of unrelated types. Do not default to one class
  per file. Put `{Type}ExampleFactory` (and its examples data, plus
  `I{Type}ExampleFactory` when one was requested) in a sibling file —
  never in the production family file.

  Give each module its own folder. Put class files, markdown, and other
  module-level artifacts in that folder — not beside it, not in a flat
  dump. Not every folder is a module: treat a folder as a module only
  when it owns `.context/module-context.md`. Do not stop at an arbitrary
  depth — every folder that is a cohesive functional unit owns
  `module-context.md`. Absorb implementation-only folders (`assets/`,
  thin `config/`) into the parent description. Never put
  `module-context.md` under `.context/sessions/`.

  Document structure: H1 = module, H2 = class within that module.
  Interface (I{ClassName}) and implementation ({ClassName}) both sit under the
  same module H1 — interface first, then implementation. No fidelity section
  headers (## Model fidelity / ## Code fidelity) in the output.
  Language and modules are one section: concept prose, build order, and
  `# {path}` cards. Do not emit `## Language` then `## Modules`.
  That one section goes BEFORE the first H1 module card (or the H1s sit in it).
  At modules fidelity, stop after Purpose / Seam / Dependencies / Constraint.
  Do not emit ## {ClassName} typed compact blocks, *is a type of*,
  Child : Parent, Sources/context of this folder's own files, scan dumps,
  or runtime names nobody types (expand, invoke, install_to).
  Those wait for model, or they are internals — omit them.

  Write human-readable markdown only. Strip template markup (`<!-- Mu -->`,
  `<!-- Mv -->`, `<!-- L -->`, `<!-- Md -->`, `<!-- C -->`, and similar)
  before writing. Sit a module heading immediately above its
  `- **Purpose:**` block — no blank line between them.

  Subtypes use ## {ChildClass} : {ClassName} notation; deltas only.
  Substitute {ClassName} / {owned_property} / {param} / {Type} / ... when generating.

Do not sketch Fake{ClassName} / Isolated{ClassName} / Production{ClassName} types.
